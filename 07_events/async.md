async code


javascript is 
-> synchronous 
-> single threaded: execute in single thread


Executionn context
--> execute one line of code at a time


Blocking code Vs Non Blocking Code
 

in blocking code
as we know to read the file program can't directly read the file 
os kernal read the file sync and give it to the program 
in blocking code the the flow of program will block during this time


for Non Blocking code 
the exexution of program will continue
while reading the file async

suppose if we need to check the data from the database of user 
and then give the response after that   blocking code is required
